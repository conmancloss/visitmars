    <h2>Position in the Solar System: Where is your planet located (for example, Earth is the third planet from the Sun)? How far from the Sun does it orbit? </h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It orbits the sun at an average distance of about 142 million miles (228 million kilometers).</p>

    <h2>How long does it take for your planet to make one revolution around the Sun? (This is one year on Earth.) Is its orbit unusual? </h3>
    <p>Mars takes about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. Its orbit is slightly elliptical, meaning it is not a perfect circle, which causes variations in its distance from the Sun during its orbit.</p>

    <h2>Rotation on its Axis: How long does it take for your planet to rotate on its own axis? (This is one day on Earth.)</h4>
    <p>A day on Mars, known as a "sol," is approximately 24.6 hours long, which is just slightly longer than an Earth day.</p>

    <h2>How did your planet get its name?</h4>
    <p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, likely due to its reddish appearance, which is reminiscent of blood.</p>

    <h2>How big is your planet? How does it rate in terms of the other planets in terms of size (is it the biggest, the smallest)?</h5>
    <p>Mars has a diameter of about 4,212 miles (6,779 kilometers), making it the second smallest planet in our solar system, larger only than Mercury.</p>

    <h2>What is your planet's mass? How does its mass rate in terms of the other planets (is it the biggest, the smallest)?</h6>
    <p>Mars has a mass of about 6.42 x 10^23 kilograms, which is about 0.11 times the mass of Earth. It is the second least massive planet in the solar system, with only Mercury having less mass.</p>

    <h2>Does your planet have moons? How many? If there are moons orbiting your planet, describe them and when they were discovered.</h6>
    <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. They were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. Phobos is the larger of the two, measuring about 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter, while Deimos is smaller, with a diameter of about 8 miles (12 kilometers). Both moons are irregularly shaped and are thought to be captured asteroids.</p>

    <h2>If there are rings orbiting your planet, describe them and when they were discovered.</h2>
    <p>There are no rings around mars</p>

    <h2>What type of planet is it (is it rocky or a gas planet)? What is its internal composition?</h2>
    <p>Mars is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Its internal composition includes a core made primarily of iron and nickel.</p>

    <h2>What is the force of gravity at the surface of your planet? (For example, what would a 100-pound person weigh on your planet?)</h2>
    <p>The surface gravity on Mars is about 0.38 times that of Earth. Therefore, a person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would weigh approximately 38 pounds on Mars.</p>

    <h2>What is the composition of the atmosphere of your planet? Is it a thick or a thin atmosphere?</h2>
    <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>What is the temperature range on your planet? (use degrees Celsius)</h2>
    <p>From 20c in the day to -153c in the night-time.</p>
